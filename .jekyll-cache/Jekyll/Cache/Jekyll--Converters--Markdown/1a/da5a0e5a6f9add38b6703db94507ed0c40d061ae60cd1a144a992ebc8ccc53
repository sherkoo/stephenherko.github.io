I"Î<p>IDâ€™s are considered â€œnon-reusableâ€ code. It has weight, it makes a statement that this block of code is so important it shouldnâ€™t appear more than once on the page. It certain cases it makes sense. For example a #page-header or a #logo, why would you use those more than once? But, is it even necessary?</p>

<p>##Object Oriented
Lets put aside the argument that you should or shouldnâ€™t use IDâ€™s as CSS selectors. I believe that only using classes in your css makes you think about your architecture in a totally different light. It keeps your mind more in the sense that your code is (or should be) object oriented. It eliminates the thinking that youâ€™re styling one block of code per page when you could be writing reusable code that can be easily adapted to other parts of the siteâ€™s design as many times as it needs to be. Itâ€™s much easier to think in terms of modules and components.</p>

<p>##Is it necessary for CSS?
Going back to #page-header and #logo, would it be so bad if it was .page-header or .logo? Or how about thinking about more in the sense of a framework like .navbar and .navbar-branding.</p>

<p>##So just remove IDâ€™s?
In some situations only an ID will suffice. For example when using javascriptâ€™s getElementById or a classic â€œskip to navigationâ€ link. Using it as a CSS selector is a different story. Itâ€™s totally  up to the developer and should be used if necessary. I believe they shouldnâ€™t be used or very very sparingly.</p>
