##Lightweight
- Opens and runs very quickly
- (Never) really crashes or freezes
- Event projects with 50-100 files seem to open seamlessly

Speed is very important to my workflow. I can’t stand that feeling of waiting for my editor when my brain is already on to the next step.

##Easy To Customize
- Package manager - allows you to install extensions to help you develop more efficiently
- Fetch - Great for fetching things from github
- Emmet - Amazing for fast front end development
- Themes - Never locked into how your editor looks
- Feels like an editor you can program to fit your needs

##Quick Open
- Uses fuzzy search which allows you to search for files without typing the exact file name
- Saves time
- “:” allows you to quickly go to a line

##Overall UI
- Tabs at top - easy to see what’s open
- Files/sidebar on left
- Clean, simple and effective
- Again, very easy to change the overall colors, UI, and theme based on your preference

##Snippets
I’ve been using snippets less these days, but they still have their place in my workflow. The emmet package comes with a lot preloaded I use on a day to day. Sublime is probably the best I’ve seen at making your own snippets, customizing and organizing them.
