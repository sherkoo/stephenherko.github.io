    <h2>Wordpress &amp; PHP</h2>
    <p>
      Developing and designing custom Wordpress themes for clients. I strive to build themes from the groundup and only serving the minimum amount of code required for the project. Writing custom post types and avoiding plugins that promise shortcuts.

      <br>
      <span>Examples:</span>

    <h2>HTML5 &amp; CSS3</h2>
    <p>
      Expert knowledge of HTML and CSS. Proficient in developing the structure and styling for entire sites. Experience designing, developing, and planning entire site projects working with various frameworks such as Wordpress, AngularJS, Drupal, and Ruby on Rails. Working on large sites and learning the importance of writing scalable CSS that can be leveraged by additional team members. Taking advantage of preprocessors like SASS.

    <h2>Jquery &amp; Javascript</h2>
    <p>
      Writing custom interactive scripts for sites delivering a pleasant user experience. Using Javascript for form validations. I avoid using plugins and prewritten scripts as much as possible. This is an area I'm constantly pushing myself in. I would much rather be an engineer than a hacker. Javascript is something I'm particularly passionate about at the moment because of the MEAN stack. Also taking advantage of amazing tools like grunt.js and gulp.js.
    </p>

    <h2>MEAN Stack</h2>
    <p>
      An area I'm currently focusing on. Using my knowledge of javascript and hunger for learning new technologies to learn MongoDB, Express, Angular, and NodeJS.
